A proxy message bot for your Discord.

# What is Proxia?

Proxia is a Discord bot that proxies your messages through Discord's webhook, while supporting attachments, threads, replies, emotes, and much more, with the bonus of saving user information via a recovery key, to restore later in the event of a server being deleted.

Think of it similar to [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/)

The main goal of this this is to anonymize yourself and your server members in a Discord server. Proxia can't be turned off

Althrough Proxia supports multiple guilds, it's highly recommended you stick to having the bot in one guild.
